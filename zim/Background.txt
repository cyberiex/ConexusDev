====== Background ======
Created Saturday 16 March 2024

Multiple realities exist as part of a macro-reality, connected fractally both internally and between realitites. The connections between everything are incredibly complex, but essentialy predictable - the macro-verse is deterministic. "Quantum weirdness" occurs due to local discontinuities, which resolve themselves at a higher level (usually across one or more realities). The gateways or interstices between these realities are generally at a scale of nanometers at most - too small for any physical interaction, but allowing information leakage between realities.

Our reality - AR00 - has a relatively low occurence rate of these "[[Gloaming]]" interstices, but two other realities are known to exist, and there are almost certainly an almost infinite number of potential realities with links to our own, either directly or indirectly.
