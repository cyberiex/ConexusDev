====== Gloaming ======
Created Sunday 17 March 2024

A colloquial word for the appearance or existence of a link between realities. It stems from the fact that these events are more apparent to most people during the gloaming - the time between sunset and complete darkness. This is usually explained as a result of heightened senses associated with this time of day (historically, many reported "supernatural" events occur during this period), rather than an actual increase in frequency of these events, but the term has entered the public domain as a reference to anything considered "weird".
