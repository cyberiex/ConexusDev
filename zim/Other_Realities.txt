====== Other Realities ======
Created Tuesday 02 April 2024

Although only three independent realities have been verified as existing independently, there are undoubtedly an amlost infinite number of others. The question of the nature, quantity and relation of these other realities to our own is unanswered, but investigation into these alternative realms is a subject of intense research and  debate. Although their existence is accepted by almost all scientists and investigators, their impact on and accessibility from any of the three defined realities is a matter of debate, and they are collectively known as The Shadow, or The Umbra.
