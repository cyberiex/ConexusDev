====== AR01 ======
Created Sunday 17 March 2024

 AR01 is an enigma - it appears to be close to identical to our own, with one important difference - it is, as far as we can tell, utterly devoid of existing human life. The signs of life are all there - homes, businesses etrc - many of them  nearly identical to our own, but it is as if every human has vanished overnight. Information regarding AR01 is very sparse - we know most of what we do know of AR02 from its inhabitants, whereas all information regarding AR01 has been extrapolated from examination of the electromagnetic radiation from AR01 [[../Gloaming_Interstice_(GI).txt|GI]]'s. Various techniques to gather information across a [[../Gloaming.txt|Gloaming Interstice (GI)]] without relying on an agent on the other side have been developed and have furnished us with what little we do know. The physical structure of the reality appears very similar to our own, but certain signs of decay and destruction - highly localised - are anomolously advanced in some areas - for example, heat sources which suggest very recent signs of human occupation have been detected in areas that are severely degradde, and adjacent to otherwise pristine areas of habitation. The other disturbing feature of this reality are the large number of "blank" or "null" regions, which emit and reflect no known EM radiotion, and are therefore entirely unknown and it has been suggested that these areas are actually [[../Gloaming_Interstice_(GI).txt|GI's]] to one or more other realities which ARE effectively informational black holes.
