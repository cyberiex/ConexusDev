====== AyArEyes (Alternate Reality Interfacers) ======
Created Monday 18 March 2024

ARIs, AyArEyes, Riders, Geist - these are some names used to refer to individuals with the ability to access the senses of another person in an AR directly - in effect, to see through their eyes. This ability is rare, and forms a subset of those with the COHS genetic marker.
