====== The Gifted ======
Created Tuesday 21 May 2024

Individuals with a greater or lesser ability to influence reality directly by manipulating the Conexus. Although only recognised by science in AR02, they almost certainly exist in our reality, and are probably the orginal source of legends of witches, sorcerors, and in the case of more powerful examples, demi-gods, demons, angels etc. The ability is likely to be related to the [[../Congenita_Ontological_Hyper-Sensitivity_(COHS).txt|COHS]] genetic marker, but since these people are very rare, and understandably reluctant to be identified or "examined" (if they even realise that they have these abilities), verifying this has so far been impossible.
