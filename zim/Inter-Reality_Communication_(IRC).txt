====== Inter-Reality Communication (IRC) ======
Created Sunday 17 March 2024

Although gloaming interstices are far too small and unstable to allow the passage of matter between realities, energy (in the form of electromagnetic radiation) can and does pass between them. Since the scientific systemisation of gloaming theory, communication between realities has been standardised and protocols established to allow reliable and constant information exchange. Despite the theory of information passage being fairly well understood, there remains a mystery regarding the transmission of information between realms. Simply put, some people find it far easier to communicate , despite using exactly the same equipment as other less gifted individuals. These people are technically labelled Congenita Metaphysical Hyper-Sensitive (COHS), but are almost universally referred to as "Spooks". The difference seems to be genetic, and may be the reason for the tradition of "magical ability" (witchcraft, for example) running in families. All people manifesting a heightened sensitivity to the gloaming share a number of sequences of DNA (previously thought to be "junk" DNA) in common. People with this skill are highly sought after by those seeking to profit from alternate realities in both realms. The ability can be detected by a simple genetic test, and those with the marker are often employed by various agencies to communicate with similarly talented individuals on the other side of an interstice. 
A few "Spooks" demonstrate even stronger abilities regarding cross-reality communication -  they possess the ability to use the eyes (and in some cases other senses) of another individual in an alternate realm. They are known as "Riders", "Geist", or [[AyArEyes (Alternate Reality Interfacers]]), not to be confused with RAI's ([[../Rational_Artificial_Intelligence.txt|Rational Artificial Intelligences]]).
