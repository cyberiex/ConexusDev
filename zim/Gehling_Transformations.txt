====== Gehling Transformations ======
Created Tuesday 02 April 2024

Named after the mathemetician Ernst Gehling, and the cornerstone of [[Conexus]] theory and mathematics,  Gehling Transformations are a series of higher order functions applied to the high-dimensional mathematical phase space known as rSpace, used to study the connections between different points within that phase space. The results of Gehling Transformations can be applied to a wide range of disciplines to improve accuracy of existing procedures and techniques, and used in metaphysical research to make predictions (and possibly effect changes) in one or more realities. On a more philosophical level, Gehling transformations, and their effectivenes in describing and mapping points in different realities, support the view that different "realities" are in fact a result of different perceptions rather than objective physical realities.
