====== Nemona Klass ======
Created Thursday 04 April 2024

The Nemona Klass are an ultra secret faction within the Oras, entirely dedicated to preserving the stability and ensuring human dominance (as they see it) of the Conexus. They will stop at nothing - blackmail, assassination, terror tactics - to prevent any disruption of the delicate status-quo existing between realities. Taking their name from the ancient Lecion configuration "Nemon" and the Lexicographer Christen Klass, this organisation consists of a fanatical group of men and women who consider it their sacred duty to maintain the integrity (as they see it) of the balance between realities. They are fiercely xenophobic, to the extent that some far-right groups within the NK even consider humans of another reality inferior to themselves.
