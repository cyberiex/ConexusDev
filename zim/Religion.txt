====== Religion ======
Created Tuesday 02 April 2024

The knowledge of the scientific verification of the existence of alternate realities, while not explicitly suppressed, has to a large extent been played down in our reality. This may explain the negligible impact of this infomation on religion here - most major religions in AR00 have a long history of ignoring inconvenient scientific facts, and a large proprtion of the population either doesn't believe in ARs or considers it an area of study which has no real significance to their lives, much the same as people's attitude to Quantum physics, Astronomy etc.

The case in AR02 is slightly different. Largely due to the higher prevelance of GI's, the Roman Catholic Church officially considers research into and experimentation with other realities a sin. More than one Christian preacher has likened other realms to hell or purgatory. The two other Abrahamc faiths (Judaism and Islam) hold generally similar views, while many eastern religions (particularly Hinduism) already accept the existence of numerous other realms as a part of their mythology.
