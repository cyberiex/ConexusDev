====== Oras ======
Created Thursday 04 April 2024

The Oras is a collective term for a highly ascetic sect of Christianity who, over many many generations in AR02, have tried to maintain stability between the realities that they have access to. Oras believe that the current state of realities exist on the brink of utter disorder, and that only careful monitoring and control of communication between realities, and, in more technical terms, understanding and control of the Conexus, can ensure mankinds future, and in fact the future of the entire planet. While many scientists of both communicating realities (AR00 and AR02) agree that humanity (and life in general) can only exist in the border between ordered and chaotic states, the Oras take things a step further by insisting that the existence of humanity is the ONLY truly valid case of these states, believing that any other lifeform, no matter how intelligent, is somehow inferior to humanity.
