AR00 : Our reality. Gloaming interstices rare but existing - not scientifically accepted, but researched and analysed by a few "fringe" scientists and conspiracy theorists.

AR01 : Either dead, as in no life at all, but totally existing infrasctructure and established structures - kind of Marie - Celeste scenario. Otherwise, no human life but every other kind....  either way, more glaoming activity than SAR00 (and maybe AAR02 ??) but otherwise not much different to AR00.

AR02: Depending on the scenario, either very simlar to AR00, but more advanced technologically  (basically cyberpunk), or a kind of neo-gothic steam/cyberpunk - victorian inflected everthing from architecture to social structure...kind of Arabesque-ish...empire-based, so British, German, French, Spanish and Russian empires, all advanced tehcnologically, all retarded socially. One massive war in the first half of the 20th century between the Franco-Prussian - Italian imperial forces and the British / French coalition. USA is basically a collection of relatively backward states, all vying for power...no real union, all heading towards a very right-wing republic (American civil war won by the southern states??)
